                    <p>This canyon  is a part of the big bend national park. This canyon is popular both due to its beauty but also because it is so easily accessible by car. It is possible to paddle the river in the canyon with various boats and rafts. It is also possible to take the “boomerang trip” where you can paddle upstream and then return downstream.  </p>

                    <p>This is the longest and deepest canyon in the big bend park. It has stunning scenery and is also easily accessible. Most of the river within the canyon is calm and camping sites are frequent in this area. Fun fact, this canyon is actually deeper than Grand Canyon. </p>
